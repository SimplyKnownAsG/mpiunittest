Python Version
==============

Currently using Python 2.7 with lots of imports from __future___.

Project Structure
=================

The project structure is this:

{{{
  ./mpiunittest/ -- source files, the "actual" package
  ./mpiunittest_tests/ -- unit tests for this mpiunittest.
  ./sample_tests/ -- sample tests, used in mpiunittest_tests.
}}}

If you're confused, then that's what you are.
